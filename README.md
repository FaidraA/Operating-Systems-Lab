This is the repositories for the projects made for the Operating Systems Laboratory class. The first excercise was trouble-shooting a program given to us that we could not open (Riddle), 
therefore a lot of the solutions are not seperate programs but commands on the Linux terminal. The second one is contained in the folder lunix_tng while the third one is in the folder
exc3. The reports for these projects, as well as the specifications we were given in order the make them are also provided.

Collaboration with Constantinos Pefkianakis
